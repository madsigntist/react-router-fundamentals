# React Router In-Depth Project

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) in a modern React application. It covers:

- **Basic Routing:** Setting up routes for different pages (Home, About, Careers, Help, NotFound).
- **Nested Routes:** Organizing routes with nested layouts for sections like Careers and Help.
- **Layout Components:** Using layout components to share UI across multiple routes.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Displaying details for individual careers using route parameters.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error pages for not found routes and data loading errors.
- **Breadcrumbs:** Showing navigation breadcrumbs based on the current route.
- **Data Loading:** Fetching data for routes (e.g., careers list and details) using loaders and json-server.
- **Custom 404 Page:** Handling unmatched routes with a NotFound component.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the mock API server for careers data:
   ```sh
   json-server --watch data/db.json --port 4000
   ```
   The app fetches career information from [http://localhost:4000/careers](http://localhost:4000/careers).
3. Start the React app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
